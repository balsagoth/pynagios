PyNagios |release| Documentation
====================================

Overview
--------

**PyNagios** is a Python library for writing `Nagios <http://www.nagios.org/>`_
plug-ins. Writing a Nagios plug-in typically involves conforming to a
`large list of guidelines <http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html>`_,
and this library removes the boilerplate necessary in writing your own
plug-ins.
